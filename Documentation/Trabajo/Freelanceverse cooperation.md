**Suggested corrections on source file:**

- Line 11: capitalize *i* in *i want*
- Line 12: comma after *applying for a job*
- Line 13: where *it can be kicked out* should be *you could be kicked out*
- Line 46: I would put a period after *It's very important*, and the *i* at the end of the line should be capitalized
- Line 58: First letter should be capitalized, since it clearly begins a new sentence
- Line 87: *person to person* instead of *person to personal*

**Questions:**

- Do you rather speak to people as a group, or as individuals?
- Should titles of each section be on italics or some other distinctive way? Like, "Hobbies"
- Box of summary? I am not sure how to phrase this one.

Not necessarily within a box, this is more a design choice. Am I right? Or you mean something different? I translated as summary for the time being. Please correct me if I am mistaken.
- Línea 130: A better example of that client? Of that? Or just a better example?
- Línea 134: "directly go to the LinkedIn" or "dircectly go to your LinkedIn"
- Línea 139: "template I made in the description" should be "template I made is in the description"
- What about WPS?
