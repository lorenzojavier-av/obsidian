You want to talk about your work but, you don't want to break your NDA. Let's look at how you can describe your work.

**Talking About What You Are Doing**

Maybe you want to share an update with your friends on social media or someone asks you about work - what do you say?

How can you discuss the type of work on a CV or in a job interview?

You can proudly say:

_"I am an Independent Contractor registered with Pactera EDGE's OneForma._ 

_I work following a set of client instructed guidelines in projects such as_  _data collection, photo collection, internet judging, transcription and/or translation."_

Let's look at some common scenarios below:

**Posting On Social Media**

You can post that you're working as an Independent Contractor on a project or project(s) on your social media. You should not give exact details about the project, the guidelines, the client, etc.

You may say what **_type_** of project you are working on - data collection, internet judging, transcription, or translation - but you should not go into fine details of what the project includes.

A good rule is to refer to the details of a project as it appears in a OneForma job advert you see on OneForma's social media page or in the job description listed on the work opportunities section of OneForma.

For example, if you are working on a project where the job advert says it is a photo collection project collecting pictures of animals, you may say, _"I'm really enjoying working on a new project with OneForma at the moment. It's a photo collection project taking pictures of animals, what could be cuter?"_ 

You **_could not_** say or show how the OneForma interface works to collect the photographs, any labeling you are required to do as instructed by the guidelines or other project-specific instructions, etc.

Often friends or family may ask if they can join too, and you can direct them to either a specific job posting on a OneForma social media channel or to the application page for new contractors at [https://jobs.oneforma.com/](https://jobs.oneforma.com/) where they can view different listings. You may also direct them to [https://my.oneforma.com/](https://my.oneforma.com/) where they can register with OneForma immediately.

**Referencing Your Work on Resumes and LinkedIn**

You may refer to your role with OneForma on your resume/CV as an Independent Contractor and note the types of project(s) you have worked on. You cannot name the project or client, or their code name, and you should refer to the project in broad terms such as data collection, internet judging, etc.

For example, you may write something like:

_"I worked as an Independent Contractor role with OneForma undertaking several projects such as data and photo collection. This comprised following a set of guidelines to collect and/or judge data to the client's specifications. Such projects provide and curate data for the advancement of client endeavors such as AI, Machine Learning, and search functions."_

_or_

_"I worked as _an Independent Contractor role with OneForma on several transcription projects, which involved transcribing to a client's specific style and requirements as per their guidelines."__

You are not allowed to go into any more specific details about the projects but you should consider referring to the skills that you have used or developed during such projects. For example:

-   self-motivation.
-   time-management skills.
-   ability to communicate with project managers digitally in a professional manner.
-   ability to adapt to different guidelines and client requirements such as differing transcription formats required on different projects.

OneForma cannot provide individual references.
