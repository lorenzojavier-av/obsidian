Your Contact Information will be held securely by the Study Organizer, and access  
limited to those Study Organizer personnel who need access to administer and

describe this data e.g. “Coded Study Data”). Your Coded Study Data will  
be disclosed to and maintained by Study Sponsor.  

Although all Study Data that identifies you will  
be protected and treated as confidential, total confidentiality cannot be  
guaranteed. It is possible that members  
of the Study Team could identify you just from your Coded Study Data  
(for instance if the Study Data includes photo images of you), or there could  
be unauthorized access to, or security breaches of, the systems used to store  
your Study Data. There may be other privacy risks that we have not foreseen.

information on how Study Data will be kept secure and confidential, please

INTERNATIONAL  
TRANSFER OF STUDY DATA.  

Your  
Consent to Transfer. Study Sponsor is  
a global company with affiliates in many countries undertaking research and  
development. As a result, your Study Data, including Coded Study Data, may be  
transferred to Study Sponsor in the United States and other Study Sponsor  
related entities and third parties designated by Study Sponsor in other  
countries. These other countries may not have laws as protective as the data  
protection laws in the country where you reside. It is also possible that the  
country to which the Study Data is sent will have laws that permit the government  
to request access to data held by private companies, such as Study Sponsor;  
however, we do not anticipate such requests for your Study Data. Regardless of  
the country where your Study Data is used and maintained by Study Sponsor, its  
affiliates, and its contracted third parties, it will be used and maintained  
only for the purposes described in this consent and it will be protected as

transferred internationally, you should not sign this Consent. However, you

Data Transfer Mechanisms. In addition to your consent to transfer, the Study

Data, transferred among participating APEC economies.
