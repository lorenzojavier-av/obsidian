**15:24** Hola. Las horas pasan. Tengo un problema. Necesito responder a Donna y Moti.

A ver, ¿cuál es mi traba?

Moti me preguntó cuál es el cronograma del colectivo. Me preguntó cuándo me podría llegar y a qué hora necesitaría irme. Y qué día prefería, si alguno.

Prefiero el miércoles. Hay tres colectivos por día, salen de El Bolsón a las 7:30 AM, 1:15 PM, y 18:30 PM. S


Alright, I think wednesday would be the best day. There are three buses, at 7:30 AM, 1:15 PM, and 18:30 PM. I could go on the earliest one, and be at the farm by 9 AM. Then come back either at 1:30 PM to catch the mid-day bus, or at 6:30 PM for the last one. I think the latter would be best. That way I would have plenty of time, and if there is not enough work I can always visit or go for a walk.

About the bus fare, if you are happy paying for that, that would be awesome. Thank you :)

Regarding the computer battery, I went today to the store and showed the photos to the technician. He wants to see the computer by himself to be sure, somehow the battery serial number is not enough for him. He only needs to spend a bit of time with it, so you could have it back the same day and only bring it down again for the replacement, when he gets it.
