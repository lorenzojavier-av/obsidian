## Nota Diaria, Nuevo Sistema

Situation: an Appen representative sent me an e-mail asking for a CV in order to continue my job application process. I am now building a CV. I need a story. Dare I spell a simple, awkward story? To myself and no other. Then I will entrust it to It, and It will say what's what. Then I will send it proudly. I will get this job.
