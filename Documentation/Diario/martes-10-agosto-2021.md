*Even if no one read it, I would blog every day. I think everyone should do so. And here is the reason: if you know that tomorrow, you have to say something about something you noticed, about something that might help somebody else, about an opinion you might have that might stand the test of time; you will form those opinions, you will notice those things, you will invent that idea. And if day after day, week after week, you leave a trail behind of thoughtful examination of your world, you can't help but get better at whatever it is you seek to do. And if as a product other people read it and trust you more, that's a jackpot.*

*My goal is to be trusted, in a way that I can make the change that I seek to have happen in the world. Return on trust. How do you gain permission to talk to people in a way that they want to be talked to? You don't do that with SEO, and with gaming social media strategies. You do that by showing up in a way that you'd want someone to show up for you.*

*Have an instinct to ship.*

*Buzzer Management.*

*Making promises and keeping them.*
