### Cover Letter
Hello, I am a native Spanish speaker looking for work experience on Upwork.
I like the kind of work you seem to require, and though I am not quick at transcriptions yet, I wish to gain some experience and reputation doing that. I am a consientious and reliable person with a passion for language.

Is there a way we could collaborate? I could take care of a file or two to begin with, and charge you based on what you consider the minimum fair amount for a given lenght of audio time transcripted.

I hope you consider me, it could be really good for both! 

In any case, I wish you the best with this project. Good bye!


### What questions do you have about the project?
I would like to know what this project is about (what are the interviews about?),  and why it matters to you.

### Why do you think you are a good fit for this particular project?
I am a great listener, and I love to do work related to language and communication. I spent hundreds of hours listening to interviews, and I have been wanting to do work as a translator or transcriber for a while. And I am a really nice person to work with.
