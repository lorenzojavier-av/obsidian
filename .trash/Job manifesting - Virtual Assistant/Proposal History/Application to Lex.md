15. List podcasts you listen to regularly and enjoy, from most favorite to least favorite, separated by commas. Leave empty if you don't listen to podcasts. _Note: Please don't answer this with what you think I'd want to hear. I don't care about what you include and don't. I just want to learn more about your interests, plus I love all kinds of podcasts and want to get suggestions ;-)_


JRE, Jordan B. Peterson Podcast, The Futur, Tom Bilyeu, Lex Fridman, Duncan Trussel Family Hour, Naval, Jocko Podcast, DarkHorse


17. Describe the tasks you see yourself doing as part of this position. I value good organization and attention to detail.

I could get you information about people you consider inviting to your podcast, and once I understand your way of working, communicating, and managing your time I could also take care of reaching them on your behalf to concert an appointment.

About the inboxes, once I know how much time you are willing to spend each day or week reading and answering messages, and what your priorities are, I could send you a list with the ones that seem to fit the framework, maybe copy them into a file so you can focus on reading them right away without going to your email or any other platform where you might get distracted until you need to go there to answer. I envision some other ways to go about this.

Finally, If there are any appointments or reservations, data entry or collection, that you don't need to do yourself, I would happily take care of that.

18. Tell me why you want to work with me and how you can help make awesome stuff.

Why.
I saw you on JRE a little more than a year ago. Since then you are one of my favorite people to listen to. I value the quality and subjects of the conversations you conduct, and the sincerity and kindness you speak with. I'm looking to do work that matters with/for people I respect. Communication that is truthful and generative is one of my highest interests. If I can help you with your podcast, that would be an honor.

How.
To begin with, I can help you by unloading your mind from whatever task I can do in your stead. Gathering relevant information and helping you answer people's messages I can do for sure. I am more than willing to learn Python, video editing, and whatever else fits my capabilities that might be useful in helping you. I'm a super curious person and a maker, so I have some skills in problem-solving and learning new things when there is an application for them.
I'm naturally attentive to detail, and organization I learned through seeing the unnecessary chaos and confusion its lack creates. So I would make sure to have clarity about your needs and expectations so we can work together efficiently and joyfully.
