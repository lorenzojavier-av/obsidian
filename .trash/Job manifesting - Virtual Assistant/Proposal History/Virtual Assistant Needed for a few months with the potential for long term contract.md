Hello, I am in need of a person who is able to do tasks for a small business virtually. The task range from: - Reviewing of data for accuracy - Transferring (copy and paste) information from one document to another accurately - Simple data input into airtable As of now, those are the only things required. There are different places the information will need to be sent during the process. It will require the ability to check in a few times a week to make sure no information is sitting waiting to be moved to next place. Non disclosure agreement will be required prior to hiring. If interested, please let me know your hourly rate for said duties.


## Cover letter

Hello, I find this position tremendously appealing. It seems to me you need somebody who can take care of tasks that are fairly simple but need to be conducted conscientiously. I have currently 20 hs per week that would gladly commit to this kind of work. Would you please share some more details with me? Like an example of the data you need to have reviewed, and what would an ideal week of collaboration look like from your side?

-   **Why do you think you are a good fit for this particular project?**
    
    I have some experience digitalizing files for a retired university professor, pertaining to an old experiment dear to him. I scanned them, used OCR to extract the text, and then went through each page correcting errors and formatting. It took a week, and I enjoyed the whole process. I am also a creative person and very motivated to incorporate new tools into my bag, I will learn easily how to use whatever software is needed for the task at hand.
