##Upwork
	Hello! I am a beginner VA.
As a creative person with multiple skills and a passion for helping people from my computer station, I offer to help you do what only you can do, by unloading your mind from the menial tasks.
Now, I might not be able to wash your dishes (unless you have an RC robot?), but here are just some things I could  happily do:
- Help you sort your inbox and highlight what is worthy of your time,
- gather information,
- book services,
- make appointments,
- translate or proofread something from/to Spanish
- write subtitles or transcriptions
- draw doodles,
- design furniture.

Types of tasks:  
\* "Please lookup websites for these companies or people and create a list."  
\* "Please research the best vacuum cleaners, building a spreadsheet with price, ratings, links, etc."  
\* "Please go to this website, login, review and correct this audio transcription."  
\* "Please scrape the values from this website into an Excel spreadsheet and share it on DropBox"  
\* "Please find the latest news on company XYZ"
