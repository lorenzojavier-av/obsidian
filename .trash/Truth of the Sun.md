00:09

welcome

00:10

to the reality revolution i am your host

00:12

brian scott

00:14

so today i wanted to dedicate an episode

00:17

to some of the things that quo

00:19

and raw say about the sun

00:22

one of the things that fascinates me the

00:24

most about the law of one material

00:27

is the discussion of the sun as the

00:29

sub-logos

00:31

and once i had read this material it

00:33

became so exciting the idea that the sun

00:35

is this living being and could be the

00:37

jehovah

00:38

that we read of in the bible right it

00:40

could be the god that created this

00:42

planet when we're praying to

00:44

a particular god it's this sub logos and

00:47

then the idea of the sub logos a portion

00:50

of intelligent energy

00:52

that's created in a specific area and

00:54

then you start to imagine

00:55

all these other stars are aspects of the

00:58

creator

00:59

it's an amazing thought and there's some

01:02

interesting discussion of

01:04

the sun we know that ra in some

01:07

circles was looked back upon as a sun

01:09

god

01:10

perhaps that's from some myths that got

01:13

interwoven with truths about

01:15

ra in ra's discussion of the sublogos

01:18

but when you

01:19

look up at the sun you could be looking

01:22

at the sun now i don't recommend looking

01:24

at the sun

01:26

there was an episode i had recently

01:27

where jesse bedro talked about

01:30

sun gazing and just you know do that be

01:32

careful

01:33

if it's done properly but you know the

01:36

sun's there when you feel it on your

01:38

back

01:39

is that actually god if you knew god was

01:42

a physical being that you

01:44

could be closer to then if we get closer

01:46

to the sun are we getting closer to god

01:48

the sun fascinates me we know from

01:51

the walter russell material about the

01:54

secret of light and you start to see

01:56

that everything

01:57

all the matter around you is made up of

01:59

light and the central source of light

02:02

in the solar system is the sun so

02:05

everything that you see around you is

02:06

the sun

02:07

all around you or there's some

02:08

interesting things that quo and raw

02:10

say regarding this discussion

02:14

but it began in the raw material

02:18

and if you read the 29th session you get

02:19

this beautiful discussion of this

02:21

concept

02:22

it begins and they say i am right greet

02:25

you in the love and light of the one

02:26

infinite creator i communicate now

02:30

don elkins whose questioning then asks

02:33

is our son

02:34

a sublogos or the physical manifestation

02:37

of a sub-logos

02:38

raw says this is correct then i am

02:41

assuming that this sub-logos created

02:43

this planetary system

02:45

in all of its densities is this correct

02:49

raw says i am raw this is incorrect the

02:52

sublogos of your solar entity

02:54

differentiated some

02:56

experiential components within the

02:58

patterns of intelligent energy

03:00

set in motion by the logos which created

03:04

the basic conditions and vibratory rates

03:08

consistent throughout your what you have

03:10

called major galaxy

03:13

then is this sublogos which is our sun

03:15

the same sublogos

03:18

just manifesting in different parts

03:19

throughout the galaxy

03:21

or is it all the stars in the galaxy

03:24

what i'm saying is there are roughly 250

03:27

billion stars

03:28

somewhat like ours in this major galaxy

03:31

are they all part of the same

03:33

sub logos raw says they are all part of

03:37

the same logos

03:39

your solar system as you would call it

03:41

is a manifestation somewhat

03:43

and slightly different due to the

03:45

presence of a sublogos

03:49

let me be sure i'm right then our sun is

03:51

a sublogos of the logos of the major

03:53

galaxy

03:54

this is correct are there any

03:57

sub-sub-logai

03:59

that are found in our planetary system

04:01

that are sub to our sun

04:03

this is correct would you give me an

04:06

example of what i

04:07

will call a sub sub logos

04:11

one example ra says is your mind body

04:14

spirit complex

04:17

they ask then every entity that exists

04:20

would be some type of sub

04:22

or sub sub logos is that correct

04:25

this is correct down to the limits of

04:27

any observation for the entire creation

04:30

is alive then the planet which we walk

04:33

upon

04:33

here would be some form of sub-sub-logos

04:36

is that correct

04:38

a planetary entity is so named only as

04:41

logos

04:42

if it is working in harmonic fashion

04:44

with entities or mind-body complexes

04:47

upon its surface or within its

04:49

electromagnetic field

04:52

do the sub-low guy such as our sun have

04:55

a metaphysical polarity

04:57

positive or negative as we have been

04:59

using the term

05:01

raw says as you use the term this is not

05:04

so

05:05

entities through the level of planetary

05:08

have the strength of intelligent

05:10

infinity through the use of free will

05:14

going through the actions of beingness

05:17

the polarity is not thusly as you

05:20

understand polarity

05:22

it is only when the planetary sphere

05:24

begins harmonically interacting with

05:27

mind-body complexes and more especially

05:31

mind-body

05:31

spirit complexes that planetary spheres

05:35

take on distortion

05:37

due to the thought complexes of entities

05:39

interacting with

05:40

planetary entity the creation of the one

05:44

infinite creator

05:45

does not have the polarity you speak of

05:48

thank you

05:49

yesterday you stated that planets in

05:51

first density

05:52

are in a timeless state to begin with

05:55

can you tell me how the effect that we

05:57

appreciate as time comes into being

06:00

raw says we have just described to you

06:03

the state of beingness of each logos

06:06

the process by which space-time comes

06:08

into continuum form

06:11

is a function of the careful building

06:13

shall we say

06:14

of an entire or whole plan of vibratory

06:18

rates

06:19

densities and potentials when this plan

06:23

has coalesced

06:24

in the thought complexes of love

06:27

then the physical manifestations begin

06:30

to appear

06:32

this first manifestation stage being

06:34

awareness

06:35

or consciousness at the point at which

06:38

this coalescence

06:39

is at the liviness or beingness point

06:43

the point or fountain had a beginning

06:45

space-time then begins to unroll

06:48

its scroll of livingness

06:50

[Music]

06:52

question i believe that love creates the

06:55

vibration in space-time

06:56

in order to form the photon is this

06:58

correct

07:00

this is essentially correct ross says

07:02

then

07:03

the continued application of love i will

07:05

assume that this is directed by a

07:07

sub-logos or a sub-sub-logos creates

07:10

rotations

07:11

of these vibrations which are in

07:13

discrete units of angular velocity

07:17

this then creates chemical elements in

07:19

our physical illusion

07:21

and i will assume the elements in the

07:23

non-physical or other densities

07:25

in the illusion is this correct

07:29

raw says the logos creates all densities

07:32

your question was unclear however we

07:36

shall state the logos does create both

07:38

the space-time densities and the

07:40

accompanying time-space densities

07:44

what i'm assuming is that quantized

07:46

incremental rotations of the vibration

07:48

show up as material of these densities

07:51

is this correct

07:53

this is essentially correct ross says

07:55

then because of these rotations

07:57

there is an inward motion of these

07:59

particles which is opposite the

08:00

direction of space-time progression

08:03

as i understand it and this inward

08:05

progression then is seen by

08:07

us as what we call gravity is this

08:09

correct

08:10

raw says this is incorrect can you tell

08:13

me how the gravity comes about

08:16

this that you speak of as gravity ra

08:18

says may be seen as the pressing towards

08:21

the inner light

08:21

love the seeking towards the spiral line

08:24

of light which progresses towards the

08:26

creator

08:27

this is a manifestation of a spiritual

08:29

event of a condition of livingness

08:33

the gravity that we know of on our moon

08:35

is less than it is on our planet

08:38

is there a metaphysical principle behind

08:40

this that you could explain

08:43

the metaphysical and physical are

08:44

inseparable thus that of which you spoke

08:46

which attempts to explain

08:48

this phenomenon is able to shall we say

08:51

calculate

08:52

the gravitational force of most objects

08:54

due to the various physical aspects such

08:56

as what you know as

08:58

mass however we felt it was necessary to

09:01

indicate the corresponding and equally

09:02

important metaphysical nature of gravity

09:06

i sometimes have difficulty in getting a

09:07

foothold into what i'm looking for don

09:09

says

09:10

i'm trying to seek out the metaphysical

09:12

principles you might say behind our

09:13

physical illusion

09:17

could you give me an example of the

09:18

amount of gravity in the third density

09:20

conditions

09:21

at the surface of the planet of venus

09:23

would it be greater or less than earth's

09:26

raw says the gravity shall we say the

09:29

attractive force which we also describe

09:32

as the pressing outward

09:33

force towards the creator is greater

09:36

spiritually

09:37

upon the entity you called venus due to

09:40

the greater degree of success so we say

09:43

at seeking the creator this point only

09:45

becomes important when you consider

09:47

that when all of creation in its

09:49

infinity has reached a spiritual

09:51

gravitational mass

09:53

of sufficient nature the entire creation

09:57

infinitely coalesces the light seeking

10:00

and finding its source and thusly ending

10:03

the creation and beginning a new

10:05

creation

10:05

much as you consider the black hole as

10:07

you call it with its conditions of

10:09

infinitely great mass

10:11

at the zero point from which no light

10:14

may be seen

10:15

as it has been absorbed

10:18

question then the black hole would be a

10:19

point at which the environmental

10:21

material

10:22

has succeeded in uniting with unity or

10:24

with the creators is correct

10:27

ross says the black hole which manifests

10:29

third density

10:30

is the physical complex manifestation of

10:33

this spiritual or metaphysical state

10:35

this is correct

10:37

then our planet is fully into fourth

10:40

density

10:41

will there be a greater gravity raw says

10:43

there will be a greater spiritual

10:45

gravity

10:46

thus causing a denser illusion question

10:49

this denser illusion than i would assume

10:52

increases gravitational acceleration

10:54

above the 32 feet per second squared

10:56

that we experience is this correct

11:00

your entities do not have the

11:01

instrumentation to measure spiritual

11:03

gravity

11:04

but only to observe a few of its extreme

11:06

manifestations

11:08

this i know that we can't measure

11:10

spiritual gravity but i was just

11:12

wondering if

11:13

the physical effect could be measured as

11:15

an increase in the gravitational

11:17

constant

11:18

that was my question the increase

11:20

measurable by

11:21

existing instrumentation would and will

11:24

be statistical

11:25

in nature only and not significant ra

11:28

says okay as the creation is formed as

11:31

the atoms form as rotations

11:34

of the vibrations which is light they

11:36

coalesce in a certain manner sometimes

11:38

they produce a lattice structure which

11:40

we call crystalline

11:42

i'm guessing that because of the

11:44

formation from intelligent energy

11:47

of the precise crystalline structure

11:50

that is possible by some technique to

11:51

tap

11:52

intelligent energy and bring it into

11:55

physical illusion

11:56

by working through the crystalline

11:57

structure is this correct

11:59

this is correct only insofar as the

12:01

crystalline physical structure is

12:03

charged

12:04

by a correspondingly crystallized or

12:06

regularized

12:07

balanced mind-body spirit complex

12:11

at a gathering in mackinac island quo

12:14

was

12:14

channeled in 2007 for a special

12:17

meditation

12:18

and the group asked quo in light of the

12:21

theme about our sun

12:22

that has developed this weekend we would

12:24

like to know what our relationship is

12:26

with our sun and how we as human beings

12:29

on planet earth may commune on a deeper

12:31

level with our sun

12:33

carla channeling says we are those known

12:35

to you

12:36

as the principle of quo greetings in the

12:38

love and in the light

12:39

of the one infinite creator in whose

12:41

service we come to you this day

12:44

may we thank you with all our hearts for

12:45

the privilege of being called to your

12:48

circle of seeking and

12:49

of being able to experience the beauty

12:51

of each of your auras and your combined

12:53

auras

12:54

which make this place a beautiful temple

12:56

of light

12:58

it is a privilege and a pleasure to be

13:01

with you

13:02

and to be able to offer our humble

13:03

service to you

13:05

the sharing of information that you

13:06

might find useful

13:08

please know that we are not authorities

13:10

over you

13:11

but fellow seekers who walk the path to

13:14

our source and our ending

13:16

take these words therefore not as things

13:19

that you must hear

13:20

or things that you must follow but

13:23

rather use your discrimination

13:25

and take from what we have to say only

13:28

those things that resonate with you

13:30

leave the rest behind without a second

13:32

thought

13:33

in this way we will feel free to offer

13:35

our opinions

13:37

without being concerned that we might

13:38

interfere with your free will

13:41

or skew and distort your process of

13:43

seeking

13:45

you wish at this time to know more about

13:47

your relationships with your sun body

13:50

and how you can commune with that sun

13:51

body we are most pleased to share our

13:54

thoughts on this subject

13:55

the one known as william noted the pawn

13:57

between sun

13:58

s-u-n and sun s-o-n and we say to you

14:03

that you are sons and daughters of the

14:04

son just as the son itself is the son

14:07

and daughter of the one great original

14:08

thought

14:10

that logos which is unconditional love

14:13

the logos is a distortion of the law of

14:15

one the only thing

14:17

that is not distorted in our

14:18

understanding is a mystery

14:21

that mystery is the one infinite creator

14:24

beyond all potentiation beyond all

14:27

understanding

14:28

all there is resides forever in that one

14:30

original creator

14:32

which is that from which all has sprung

14:35

and to which all shall return the first

14:38

distortion

14:39

of the one infinite creator is free will

14:42

and the play of free will across the

14:43

mystery of the creator created the

14:45

desire for

14:46

the creator to know itself and this

14:49

desire was embodied if you will

14:50

in the one great original thought which

14:54

is the second distortion of the law of

14:55

one

14:56

and that unconditional love which is the

14:58

very nature of the infinite creator

15:00

birth the mechanism and the way of

15:02

manifestation

15:03

of all illusion where you see all except

15:06

the mystery is some kind of illusion

15:10

so all of that which seems real

15:14

is the illusion and that which is the

15:16

mystery

15:17

is that which is real you come therefore

15:20

into the land of paradox and mystery

15:22

and then you know you are on the right

15:24

track the third distortion of the law of

15:26

one is light

15:28

and light in all of its gradations of

15:31

circulation or rotation

15:33

has created all the orders of all the

15:35

vibrations

15:36

of all that is seen and unseen from your

15:38

point of view

15:40

this logos manifesting through light

15:43

created out of itself the suns in their

15:45

galaxies

15:47

and each sun is a sub logos

15:50

an undistorted portion of the one

15:53

infinite creator

15:54

yet each logos was given the ability to

15:57

make the tailoring details

15:59

of its sub-creation of the one infinite

16:02

father

16:03

therefore your logos has created for you

16:05

a certain kind of environment

16:08

for the growth of your spirit and the

16:10

collection of information

16:11

to be offered again to the one infinite

16:15

creator

16:15

that it may know more about itself

16:19

it is well to note that this is a scheme

16:21

in which

16:22

all of your feelings be they seemingly

16:24

positive or seemingly negative

16:27

are equally valuable and precious to the

16:29

one infinite creator

16:31

therefore you are loved beyond all

16:34

belief

16:35

by an entity who could never judge you

16:38

but only support

16:40

encourage and embrace you the logos of

16:43

your son then has further manifested in

16:46

its creation the particles of the one

16:49

for each of you as a spark of the one

16:52

creator

16:53

and each of you has in every cell of

16:55

your body

16:56

the undistorted mystery of the one

17:00

your wisdom lies deep within you

17:04

you do not have to reach for it it will

17:07

come into your consciousness

17:08

as you are ready and as you ask

17:12

it helps a great deal in this process if

17:14

you know

17:15

beyond a shadow of a doubt again as the

17:17

one known as william has said

17:19

that you are in your integrity and can

17:22

rest in your rightness to ask

17:25

all are worthy to ask and be answered

17:28

therefore each of you is a piece of the

17:30

one sons and daughters and heirs of love

17:33

creatures of love you came into this

17:35

particular illusion having created for

17:37

yourself

17:38

with the aid of your guidance system

17:41

your gifts your challenges and your

17:43

relationships

17:44

you and your guidance together have

17:46

planned the direction of your mission

17:48

both in terms of the mission of your

17:50

being and the mission of your doing

17:54

in terms of the mission of your doing

17:56

you have only to consult

17:57

your gifts or what this instrument would

18:00

call your skill set

18:02

each of you has a cluster of gifts in a

18:04

particular area

18:06

it may seem to be very humble and

18:08

practical and down to earth

18:10

it may be mystical maybe aesthetic it

18:13

may be creative it may be as simple as

18:15

the creation of a family

18:17

the creation of anything that can be

18:19

created in this universe is equally

18:21

worthy if it be created with love

18:24

as this instrument was saying earlier to

18:26

the one known as jay you are never to be

18:28

identified with

18:29

that which you do rather you are love

18:32

and you happen to be expressing or

18:34

manifesting in the outer

18:36

world with a particular kind of service

18:37

for which happily

18:39

you receive pay and with which you pay

18:42

your bills

18:43

likewise you cannot be contained by

18:44

others opinions by the opinions of your

18:46

culture or by any other limitations

18:48

whatever

18:49

for you are love and light you are all

18:52

there is

18:53

and you are the son of your creation

18:57

let us expand upon this for a moment it

18:59

may seem that you are quite

19:00

a small part of a large universe

19:04

very large universe and in the outer

19:06

world this is certainly so

19:08

as the one known as don has often said

19:11

you are sticking up

19:12

from the surface of the planet like a

19:14

hair and a head

19:15

with your heads reaching towards the

19:18

stars and your feet planting toward

19:20

the womb of the earth you circle a very

19:22

insignificant looking sun

19:24

in terms of the brightness and size at

19:26

the outer part

19:27

of a very small an indistinguishable

19:30

looking galaxy that is part of billions

19:33

and billions of other galaxies in that

19:35

scale of things you are

19:37

indeed small yet in the inner or

19:40

metaphysical sense

19:42

you are the son of your inner universe

19:45

you've created that universe and you can

19:47

recreate it

19:49

at any time that which you judge remains

19:51

judged

19:52

that which you love remains loved in

19:55

every thought

19:56

in every circumstance you are the

19:59

creator

20:00

that which you hold to be true is true

20:03

therefore it is well to remain at all

20:05

times attentive

20:07

to that which is deepest within you to

20:09

that which is truest within you

20:11

and as you sense into the eye of you

20:13

remember to ask for help

20:15

in coming even more fully into the

20:18

presence of the mystery that

20:19

lies within you it is as if you are

20:22

approaching across a vast

20:23

courtyard the gateway to your open heart

20:27

that courtyard is littered with all of

20:30

your beliefs and judgment

20:32

it is thickly littered with your senses

20:35

of self

20:36

your unworthiness your dislike of your

20:39

shadow side

20:40

your desire not to show or know

20:44

your shadow side and so the journey into

20:46

full communion with your

20:48

open heart with that sun that lies

20:51

within

20:51

consists at first of going about this

20:54

courtyard

20:55

taking up the shadow side the

20:57

unworthiness the thoughts and beliefs

20:59

which limit your viewpoint they may seem

21:02

to be like wild animals when you first

21:05

take them up for indeed you have powers

21:07

within you that are very strong

21:09

and seem ultimately negative when they

21:12

are not developed by the light within

21:14

you

21:15

they may act out as murder war jealousy

21:18

anger

21:18

hatred guilt resentment and all the

21:21

brothers and sisters of these energies

21:25

yet when you take these wild animals

21:28

these fearsome energies into your arms

21:30

and love them

21:33

that gets their attention and when you

21:35

have their attention

21:37

then you may speak to them tenderly and

21:39

affectionately

21:40

for you must ask for their help you must

21:43

ask them to come into your heart

21:45

and allow themselves to be redeemed by

21:47

your sense of their worth

21:49

and by your honor and respect for these

21:51

dark energies within you

21:54

and when they kneel before you you take

21:56

the sword of truth and

21:58

you dub them your white knights of

22:00

determination grit and patience

22:02

so that you may endure all bear all

22:06

persist through all with love

22:10

as you gaze out from yourself finally

22:13

and see the clean courtyard you know

22:16

you are ready to meet the lions at the

22:18

gate of your open heart

22:20

because there are lions there my friends

22:23

who will not allow you into that sacred

22:25

space

22:26

that holy of holies that sanctum

22:29

sanctorum until you are whole

22:34

it is not that you become perfect and

22:36

then enter the open heart

22:38

you enter the open heart in all your

22:40

dirt just as you are

22:42

and yet the secret is to know that you

22:44

are worthy just as you are

22:46

and give honor to yourself even within

22:50

this illusion in which you seem to be

22:52

quite unworthy in some ways

22:54

this surety and confidence is your

22:56

strength and your salvation

22:58

and the lions then sense your readiness

23:01

for the light within your open heart

23:04

and the love that lies waiting to

23:05

embrace you

23:07

the lions bow the door opens and you are

23:10

finally home

23:11

what a joy it is to be home in your own

23:14

open

23:14

heart at the center of your creation

23:17

where the lion and the lamb

23:19

lie down together where peace flows like

23:22

a mountain

23:24

where all upon which you look as blessed

23:27

and being blessed blesses you back

23:30

so love is reflected in love

23:34

so all that you see is love so that all

23:37

you

23:37

do is love

23:40

as you open to this upwelling of love

23:43

that is infinite and

23:44

infinitely available the ever

23:46

self-sustaining resource of the one

23:48

infinite creator you become that which

23:51

is

23:52

i am that i am and your small ego has

23:55

melted away

23:57

before that impersonal self that is at

23:59

the heart

24:00

of the personal self it may seem to you

24:04

there are impediments to becoming the i

24:06

am that i am

24:07

of what this instrument would call

24:09

cosmic consciousness or christ

24:10

consciousness

24:12

as long as you feel that there are

24:13

impediments so there are

24:15

therefore as you experience the feeling

24:17

of being impeded

24:19

it is well to rest in that awareness and

24:21

to collect yourself to bear witness to

24:22

this awareness

24:24

and to sit with it as if it were an

24:26

honored guest

24:28

what is it that impedes you this day

24:31

what thought has caused you to stop

24:33

feeling

24:34

as though you are the one infinite

24:36

creator in much

24:37

shadowed form sit with this question

24:40

until it begins to answer itself within

24:43

you in whatever way it will

24:46

experience to the fullest the energy of

24:48

that blocked

24:49

self was it impatience was it irritation

24:53

was it the feeling of unworthiness

24:56

was it the hesitation that comes from

24:59

being confused

25:01

whatever that momentary blockage is

25:02

first experience it

25:04

and intensify it and then allow it to

25:06

call forth its dynamic

25:08

opposite if your stoppage

25:11

was due to impatience allow the feeling

25:14

of patience to come over you

25:17

for it will if you focus upon this

25:19

dynamic

25:21

once you have begun to experience that

25:22

patience

25:24

then encourage it to intensify itself

25:26

within you and become all

25:28

of your attention span and in that

25:32

wise you may know true and undistorted

25:34

patience

25:36

then allow the two dynamics to come

25:38

together in everyday life

25:40

into the center of yourself so that you

25:42

have balanced this distortion within

25:44

yourself

25:46

it is well indeed if you can practice

25:48

this on a daily basis

25:50

for even within a day you may lose the

25:52

memory of your thoughts

25:54

and each of your thoughts is a creation

25:57

metaphysically speaking

25:58

this is difficult to understand in

26:00

everyday life because in the outer world

26:02

things

26:03

and objects are what seem to be real and

26:05

thoughts are the lightning bugs and

26:07

butterflies and moths

26:09

and all those little beings that fly

26:10

about they are

26:12

beautiful and they are worthy of their

26:14

own kinds

26:16

and yet should you take them seriously

26:18

we say to you yes

26:20

my friends for in the metaphysical world

26:22

thoughts

26:23

are things

26:26

what you think is what you create

26:29

the one known as g gave this instrument

26:31

a story recently from indian lore

26:34

it was the story of two wolves one wolf

26:36

was everything that was good positive

26:38

and beautiful

26:39

the other wolf was dark aggressive

26:42

violent and evil

26:43

the young man went to his father and

26:45

said what should i do with these wolves

26:47

how shall i treat them and the father

26:49

said feed the one

26:50

you wish to grow and let the other one

26:52

pass away

26:54

which wolf will you feed in your

26:57

thoughts

26:58

one great secret spiritual seeking

27:01

is to remember which wolf to feed we

27:04

sense that within this group there are

27:06

many questions

27:07

and so we would ask if there is a

27:09

follow-up question to this question

27:13

they then ask yes i have a question

27:14

about the sun cult that has been

27:16

in earlier times do we have any

27:18

connection to this and

27:20

to each other through that we may say

27:22

without infringement quote says upon

27:24

free will that there are

27:26

those among you who indeed do have that

27:28

connection within

27:29

the history of your planet however in

27:31

general we would say that your

27:32

connection to the sun is from your

27:34

nature

27:35

as those who come from another sun and

27:38

who have chosen to wander this planet

27:39

together

27:40

for each in this room is a portion of

27:42

wanderers of six density who choose in a

27:45

time very early in the third density

27:48

cycle of planet earth to enter into

27:49

incarnation

27:51

upon planet earth after the first 25 000

27:54

year minor cycle of your planetary third

27:56

density

27:57

the confederation of planets in the

27:58

surface of the one infinite creator

28:00

became concerned for the harvest was

28:02

very small

28:04

and so an excitement of heart with great

28:06

passion an

28:07

absolute purity of intent you dedicated

28:10

yourselves

28:11

to the travail of earth brothers and

28:13

sisters of sorrow

28:16

you responded to the sorrow of earth

28:20

to its cry for light and love and so you

28:23

came bravely

28:24

daringly risking all

28:27

risking forgetting who you are in the

28:30

hope

28:31

that you could become those who aided in

28:33

the lightning

28:34

of the consciousness of planet earth

28:38

my friends you have been about that

28:40

business for a very long time and may

28:43

have you have become wary with the labor

28:46

of earth

28:47

but we say to you to take heart and to

28:49

know that you have made a difference

28:52

in a positive sense and that you shall

28:54

as you

28:55

are activated by such meetings as these

28:58

wind up your certainty and courage

29:01

that you may go forth ever more firmly

29:03

seated

29:04

in the saddle of your great steed of

29:06

faith

29:07

in your armor of light with your ribbons

29:10

dancing in the wind from the lance of

29:11

your

29:12

truth you may joust with some unlikely

29:14

people

29:15

mounted on some shabby shabby horses as

29:18

you go through the lists of this

29:20

tournament of service to others

29:22

there may be many many times when the

29:24

chinks in your armor of light

29:26

are intensified by the natural

29:27

resistance of what this instrument calls

29:30

the loyal opposition

29:33

and you may experience difficulties and

29:35

dark nights

29:36

yet my friends is not each dawn a new

29:39

day

29:41

it is indeed as you awaken on each new

29:43

day know

29:44

that it is a new universe a new world

29:46

and a completely new beginning

29:49

nothing is ever old to those who are

29:51

awake to love

29:52

everything is new now

29:56

each of you is wondering as we listened

29:59

while you talked around the circle

30:02

we heard you say what is next what shall

30:05

i do now

30:07

my friends the operant word is now it is

30:10

not next

30:11

it is now what you shall do now is what

30:14

is upon your heart and if as far as you

30:18

know there is nothing upon your heart

30:19

except love

30:20

then let it be you are now ready for

30:24

that which comes next in your illusion

30:26

nor are you responsible in any way for

30:28

that which comes to you as catalyst

30:30

it is not that you draw a good catalyst

30:32

or poor catalyst or difficult catalyst

30:35

by some measurement of deserving or

30:36

merit certainly that which you are

30:38

thinking or doing creates the nexus

30:40

from which more things come to you as

30:43

you think so you draw things to you

30:45

yet in that moment in which catalyst

30:48

occurs to you

30:49

you are not responsible for that which

30:51

comes in

30:52

the area of your responsibility is to

30:55

that which is evoked or elicited

30:57

by the catalyst therefore you as

31:00

creators are responsible for your

31:01

responses to catalyst

31:04

what shall be your responses to this day

31:06

to the thoughts you think to the people

31:07

you meet

31:08

into the situations which you address

31:11

what is your area of creativity

31:13

it is a good thing to focus upon the

31:15

fact that you are all creative

31:17

how can a creator not be creative

31:20

therefore create your creation

31:22

consciously and do not be dismayed that

31:24

the outer world does not seem to reflect

31:26

your creation

31:27

in the world of spirit in the time space

31:29

universe you are the citizens of

31:31

eternity

31:32

even while within the world of space

31:34

time and incarnation

31:36

that which you create is powerful and as

31:38

you understand that you can link up with

31:40

those who are of like mind even at great

31:43

distances you can continue to create

31:45

light

31:47

the instrument was speaking earlier in

31:48

this weekend being instruments receivers

31:50

and emitters of vibration and so you

31:53

are in the unseen realms and we

31:54

encourage you to think of yourselves as

31:56

lighthouses

31:58

it said in your holy work do not hide

32:00

your light under a bushel

32:02

but place it on a lamp stand where all

32:04

may see it

32:06

do you feel merely like a candle of

32:08

light in the midst of all

32:10

the darkness of the outer world then my

32:13

friends know

32:14

that a candle can be seen a mile away

32:16

just one candle can be a beacon of light

32:19

to those far off those to whom

32:22

you are a source of light know

32:25

only that they like to be near you

32:29

yet as they absorb the radiation of your

32:32

love

32:33

they themselves are activated to be

32:35

beacons themselves

32:37

and so you pass it on and infect others

32:40

who in turn

32:40

infect others until the world at last is

32:43

aflame

32:44

unified harmonious and complete

32:49

shall this happen before the harvest is

32:50

complete we do not know for it is up to

32:53

you

32:54

to be as purely a flame of love as you

32:57

know how to be

32:59

however look not to the outer things for

33:01

knowledge of your success

33:03

rather look to your intentions your

33:04

dreams and your ideals

33:07

and create from them ever firmer ever

33:09

truer ever sturdier

33:11

these are the measures the ability to

33:14

create changes

33:15

in your consciousness of your planetary

33:17

sphere

33:18

therefore the most important work that

33:21

you can do

33:22

is done within yourself for as you heal

33:24

strengthen and

33:25

arm yourself with love and light so you

33:27

change your entire world

33:30

question regarding ultraviolet and

33:32

infrared rays of the sun

33:33

i understand that some energies from the

33:35

sun say gamma rays and x-rays are

33:37

harmful

33:38

and i understand that uv in some cases

33:40

is said to be harmful and sometimes not

33:42

i feel that there isn't enough

33:44

information out there about uv and maybe

33:46

the benefits of it is it worthy to

33:48

accumulate uv into the body is there

33:50

a spiritual physical emotional or mental

33:53

aspect to that

33:54

can you change the dna in your genes

33:56

with this uv or

33:57

even infrared we are those of quo and we

34:00

are aware of your query

34:02

my sister there are parts of your query

34:04

which we cannot answer due to the fact

34:06

that this is part of your active

34:07

spiritual process

34:09

at this time and it would be a gross

34:11

infringement of your free will to

34:13

do your learning for you we leave you

34:15

the joy of your exploration

34:17

in this wise however

34:20

we may respond to your concerns about

34:22

the need for balancing the self as it

34:24

receives

34:25

what you may consider toxic levels of

34:27

certain vibrations

34:29

we would encourage you to investigate

34:31

the work of the one known as rudolph

34:33

steiner and especially in his exercises

34:35

to balance in a dynamic way the body

34:37

complex

34:38

this instrument knows this

34:41

anthropological type of exercise

34:44

as the olorono exercise it is a series

34:47

of simple movements that anyone can do

34:48

who can walk

34:50

this instrument being a fragile body can

34:52

still do these exercises and so can most

34:54

upon your planet

34:55

there are a simple series of exercises

34:58

which you are creating for yourself

34:59

more of a 360 degree vision and more of

35:02

a complete balance of the body

35:04

and therefore of body mind and spirit in

35:07

the process of doing these exercises

35:09

daily you shall find that whatever is in

35:10

excess within your body complex

35:12

is released and whatever is deficient in

35:15

your body complex is restored

35:17

this entity the one known as rudolf

35:19

steiner was very clear in many ways

35:21

about this particular concern

35:23

although you will find that you must

35:24

gaze at that which he said with an eye

35:26

to the heart of what

35:28

he was manifesting in his writing as

35:30

opposed to the literal meaning of

35:32

words we leave you the joy of this

35:34

exploration

35:35

you spoke about dna in terms of

35:37

spiritual principles we say to you that

35:40

dna for third density is as it is

35:43

and yet you may change your dna as some

35:45

of you are quite sure and aware of at

35:47

this time

35:48

by the way you think and by the way you

35:50

manifest your thoughts so that you bring

35:52

forth

35:53

into third density higher densities of

35:55

awareness

35:57

those of you who wish to live into

35:59

fourth density positive upon this planet

36:02

which shall soon completely be descended

36:04

not only

36:05

inter penetrating third density but

36:09

taking over third density completely may

36:11

live as though you were in fourth

36:13

density

36:14

now it's as simple as nearly impossible

36:17

as that

36:18

but you can penetrate that mystery of

36:19

love you can change your dna so that you

36:21

create

36:22

4 then 8 and then 12 then up to 24

36:25

spirals of dna

36:27

and eventually as you do create the

36:29

differences in every cell of your body

36:31

you shall more and more

36:32

walk this universe freely in a session

36:35

in

36:36

2019 they asked quo

36:40

quo many of us are in the ascension

36:42

journey are quite sensitive

36:44

to solar activity and electromagnetic

36:46

storms it appears that the 11-year solar

36:49

cycle for

36:49

solar minimum to maximum have a very

36:52

strong impact

36:54

on the planetary ascension can you speak

36:56

to that quo says

36:57

i am quo and i'm aware of your query my

36:59

brother indeed the entity

37:01

which is your local sub-logos the sun

37:03

body

37:04

that provides the life-giving rays of

37:06

its own beingness is an

37:07

entity which is inhabited by those

37:10

of higher densities which are utilizing

37:13

the opportunity to produce

37:15

that you would see as solar flares or

37:17

energies that are

37:18

a product of their own contact with

37:21

intelligent

37:22

infinity so that this energy of the sun

37:25

and of the higher density entities

37:27

residing therein comes

37:29

in a cyclical fashion providing greater

37:31

opportunities at some points within the

37:33

evolutionary cycles

37:35

of both the sun body itself and your

37:38

earth sphere

37:38

itself there is also to be considered

37:41

the in streaming of energies

37:43

from beyond your solar system so that in

37:45

conjunction

37:46

with the cycles of flares upon the sun

37:49

body

37:50

there are the cosmic in streamings of

37:52

the fourth density vibrations

37:54

that are likened unto rhythms of a

37:56

musical instrument or a number of

37:58

musical instruments

37:59

that play a certain melody that can be

38:01

apprehended by entities within

38:03

the third density environment of your

38:05

mother earth that have

38:06

the requisite sensitivities within their

38:09

own being

38:10

to recognize and resonate with these

38:12

combinations

38:13

of the solar flares as cosmic in

38:16

streamings

38:18

there are a portion of the process of

38:19

your planet's movement

38:21

into the fourth density of love and

38:22

understanding as entities upon your

38:25

third density sphere are able to

38:26

harmonize their beings

38:28

with these cosmic and solar energies

38:31

they also emanate from themselves a

38:32

similar type of energy that may

38:34

be apprehended by those in their

38:36

presence and indeed beyond their

38:38

presence

38:39

each entity upon the planetary sphere

38:41

that is resonating with the solar and

38:43

cosmic in streamings

38:45

is thus able to act itself as a beacon

38:47

of light that

38:48

emanates these stepped down frequencies

38:51

that represent the love

38:52

the light and the unity of the one

38:54

infinite creator

38:56

that resides within each entity and is

38:58

activated by these energies

39:00

and reflects and promotes and processes

39:03

these energies to those about the entity

39:06

that is receiving them and broadcasting

39:08

them

39:10

they then ask some people seem to be far

39:12

more sensitive to these in streamings

39:14

what is the reason for that quote says

39:16

the sensitivity to the solar and cosmic

39:19

in streamings of energies is a result of

39:20

the process of the as you would say

39:23

rising of the kundalini within such

39:25

entities expressing this sensitivity

39:28

for those who have moved through the

39:29

green ray energy center

39:31

there is the beginning sensitivity to

39:33

such energies

39:35

as the kundalini energy moves higher

39:37

into the blue ray energy center this

39:39

sensitivity is once again enhanced as

39:41

the energies move yet higher into the

39:43

indigo ray these

39:44

energies are at their peak level of

39:46

expression

39:47

so that at this level there is the

39:49

ability to create changes in

39:51

consciousness

39:52

at will there is however the necessity

39:55

for the blending of all those lower

39:57

energy centers in a fashion

39:59

that is processed and produced by the

40:01

violet ray energy center

40:03

thus it is well for such entities who

40:05

are expressing the sensitivities of the

40:07

green blue

40:08

and indigo energy centers to give

40:10

constant attention

40:11

to the clearing of any catalytic

40:13

obstructions that may find a way

40:15

temporarily

40:16

into any of the lower energy centers

40:19

thusly

40:20

the entity that is sensitive to these

40:22

energies will do well to engage in a

40:23

daily

40:24

program of examining the life experience

40:26

so there is a smooth

40:27

flow of the piranha or love light of the

40:30

one creator through each energy center

40:32

ending at the indigo and in a session on

40:37

2008 they asked a question that said i

40:40

saw an interesting dvd called the solar

40:42

empire

40:42

this splendid film discusses sun spots

40:45

and solar flares

40:46

as i recall these solar phenomena may

40:48

influence all the planets in the solar

40:50

system on a physical level may we ask

40:52

quo if there is a metaphysical meaning

40:54

regarding the various phenomenon of our

40:56

sun like solar flares

40:57

and sunspots quo says that your sun body

41:00

is a sub-logos a manifester

41:03

and center of light and love which it

41:05

pours out upon

41:06

all indiscriminately generously and with

41:09

great love

41:10

as you are perhaps aware the actions of

41:13

each of you do not go unnoticed in the

41:15

universe

41:16

the creation of the father is one and

41:18

the universe balances itself endlessly

41:20

with regard to each

41:21

and every one of its infinite bits and

41:23

pieces of creatorhood which are making

41:25

the long

41:27

circular journey from alpha to omega and

41:29

entering into alpha once again

41:32

the situation of your people upon gaia

41:35

or the entity you call

41:36

planet earth is one which has been

41:38

maturing and ripening throughout your

41:40

last several thousands of years

41:42

as cycle after cycle of empire has risen

41:46

and been brought to dust

41:47

only to spawn another empire with

41:49

aggressive and hostile feelings and

41:51

emotions

41:52

buttressing the point of view that

41:54

conquers and controls

41:56

these cycles of empire have not lessened

41:58

as this last major cycle has progressed

42:00

but rather

42:01

there has been a stoppage of the

42:02

willingness of those upon your sphere

42:05

to entertain what this instrument would

42:07

call a new paradigm

42:08

we do not speak here of all those upon

42:11

your planet but rather we speak in terms

42:13

of those whose hands have been greedy

42:15

for power

42:17

due to the natural tendency of

42:20

those upon a certain path to incarnate

42:22

in bunches

42:23

shall we say you have before you now a

42:25

large group of entities

42:27

who have worked together always fighting

42:29

for position but bearing enough amity

42:31

towards each other

42:32

to conspire to control the population of

42:34

your planet

42:35

and to bend all things to their will

42:38

they have done this before

42:39

these entities have been faces at the

42:41

banquet in babylon in rome

42:44

in the holy roman empire in the third

42:45

reich and now

42:47

there are other cycles of service to

42:49

self-entities in other cultures

42:51

and those who rode with genghis khan

42:52

right now with your eastern countries

42:54

such as

42:54

china korea japan india and pakistan

42:58

israel and syria the list can go on

43:01

this phenomenon where entities who love

43:04

power

43:04

and who love control are seeking whether

43:08

consciously or unconsciously to graduate

43:10

in the service to self polarity are in

43:12

charge has mandated

43:14

an acceleration of heat of a

43:16

metaphysical type and this heat

43:18

winds itself down into earth not so much

43:21

in the physical earth but in the energy

43:22

body

43:23

of the earth shall we say causing the

43:25

earth to seek ever more diligently to

43:27

balance itself

43:29

this has its effect not only upon the

43:31

planet but also upon the sun

43:33

which streams its light to bless the

43:35

planet

43:37

you may see these increased and severe

43:39

solar flares

43:40

and other sun phenomena as the sun's

43:42

innocent and necessary balancing

43:45

of its energy field in order that the

43:47

highest and best

43:48

possible outcome may be preserved for

43:51

each and every entity

43:52

upon planet earth it is not an angry sun

43:56

that is smiting those who have done

43:57

wrongly it is simply a living being

44:00

which

44:01

in order to be in balance must express

44:03

the products of imbalance

44:05

so that balance may be regained there is

44:08

no question my friends

44:10

but that you personally all by yourself

44:12

can make a difference

44:14

in this situation insofar as you have

44:15

the ability to cease the war within you

44:19

more light is allowed into your

44:21

environment and planet earth

44:22

feels that lightning of consciousness

44:25

and is deeply grateful

44:26

she is in fact most grateful each day as

44:29

your group offers the gaia meditation

44:31

and hopes for peace

44:33

on earth and peace in the hearts of

44:35

humankind

44:36

therefore we would say to the one known

44:38

as t that there is not a metaphysical

44:41

message per se in the increased solar

44:43

flares

44:43

any more than there is a message in the

44:45

increased incidence of extreme weather

44:47

which you are experiencing at this time

44:49

it is a benign and necessary means of

44:51

adjusting and balancing the energy body

44:53

of the planet

44:55

and the energy body of the solar system

44:57

imagine

44:58

what would happen with your own vehicle

45:00

if one of your organs was a miss

45:03

say perhaps that your lungs were heavily

45:05

damaged and you

45:06

were having difficulty breathing this

45:08

would impact your ability to think

45:10

your heart function and many other

45:12

functions of the body which depend upon

45:14

the steady intake

45:15

of oxygen thusly these are symptoms of a

45:18

metaphysical illness

45:20

which we might describe as a fever which

45:22

has overtaken humankind

45:24

we would simply ask each of you to do

45:26

what you can to reduce the fever of your

45:28

own life

45:29

your own thoughts and your own heart

45:32

and to turn always with utter faith and

45:34

confidence to the holy sanctuary within

45:36

your heart

45:38

where the creator is to be found in good

45:40

weather

45:41

or poor metaphysically speaking or

45:44

physically speaking

45:46

so that is just a brief discussion of

45:48

the sun

45:49

as it's discussed in the law of one

45:51

material and in quo

45:53

and i find that super fascinating it

45:56

is a wonderful idea to know that when

45:59

you walk outside

46:00

during the day that god is right there

46:03

shining on everything everything is god

46:07

so when i say everything is god that

46:09

means the son is god

46:11

and the earth is god all things are god

46:14

there's some wonderful

46:15

passages in here where they ask one

46:18

question you're starting to get another

46:19

and they

46:20

were very inspiring about cleaning out

46:23

the courtyard of your heart and becoming

46:26

your own son in the process

46:28

of that so i hope this inspired you and

46:31

helped you to understand this concept

46:33

how exciting it is that the galaxy is

46:35

also

46:36

a logos and the sun is just a sub-logos

46:39

of the galaxy

46:40

and that there are groupings of galaxies

46:42

that are a logos

46:44

and it just keeps on going up sort of

46:46

hierarchically

46:47

but at the same time they're all levels

46:49

of the one infinite creator

46:51

all working with free will in

46:54

separate paradigms of consciousness

46:58

and it's an exciting idea to think that

47:00

solar flares are produced by other

47:03

beings that are on the sun or the solar

47:05

flares are

47:06

an eruption because of the imbalance of

47:08

energies in our planet

47:10

and the solar system itself it makes you

47:13

wonder if the sun is sort of a

47:15

reflection of the energies we have going

47:16

on in the earth and it starts to become

47:18

eruptive it's related to that i've also

47:20

heard that in relation to earthquakes

47:22

and storms

47:24

everything around you is a response to

47:26

you and what's happening within you and

47:29

what you see around you with all the

47:30

people around you is a response to you

47:32

that is the truth of the law of one we

47:34

are all one

47:35

that's why the information about the

47:37

mere reality from tran surfing

47:40

and the information that everybody is

47:41

you pushed out from neville goddard is

47:44

the same

47:44

information as the law of one

47:47

the son is us and that we are

47:51

a part of something even bigger it goes

47:53

on and on and if you

47:54

touch that part of you there's a deep

47:57

part of you that knows all of this

47:59

and i would love to get your comments

48:02

and

48:02

feelings about this particular subject

48:05

we are all sub sub low guy of the sub

48:08

logos of the logos

48:11

48:13

revolution can be found
