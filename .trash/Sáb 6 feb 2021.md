### Summer
I need to get strong.
I need to focus.
I need to choose.
I need to organize my mind.
I need a place to go for guidance.
A home to go back to.
Here I am, spinning around.
There is a will to know...
There is a list of things I want to learn...
I want to run.
I want to swim.
I solve problems.
