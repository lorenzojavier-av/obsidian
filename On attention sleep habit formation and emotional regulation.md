 ### [[Neuroscientist: "First Hour of The Morning is CRUCIAL" | Andrew Huberman]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBwM-mCLQQo)

Addiction is a progressing reduction of the things that bring you pleasure.
Enlightment is a progressing expansion of the things that brings you pleasure.

Context switch. Dopamine sources. Reward without porsuit. Pain-pleasure balance, friction. Dopamine circuits saturated, need for dopamine replenishment.

Train the no-go (a.k.a. "[[don't circuitry]]"), try to refrain to do something impulsive during the day, aim for 25 instances. This could be something trivial like wanting to go get cofee, or a candy, or watch another video. Anything small enough that I can handle it without depleting my willpower.

Also, it is better not to look at the phone on the first hour of the day. Not only Andrew, also Walker and Kwik have spoken about the importance of doing this. I really need to build a resource on [[sleep]], to see what I think about it and what the cutting edge data says. 

Here Andrew says neuroplasticity is triggered in wakefulness, but it actually takes place in sleep, specially in the second half.

When sleeping experiences get put in the propper shelf. Things like a tweet that really bothered you during the day will loose importance, important events will gain weight. Or something like that.

No sé qué pienso de todo esto. Por ahora lo dejo así.
