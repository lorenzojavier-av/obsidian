## What are the 3 different types of income?

The three main types of income to consider are:

### Active income

If you have a job and receive a paycheck, you make your money through active, also called earned, income. This essentially means you're exchanging time and energy, or material participation, for money. Active income includes payment in the form of wages, salaries, tips and commissions. For example, if you work as a cashier at a grocery store, the money you make hourly would be considered active or earned income because you're actively completing tasks and interacting with customers throughout each shift. Other examples of active income include:

-   Customer service work
-   Writing and editing
-   Management
-   Advertising
-   Sales
-   Software development
-   Web design
-   Marketing
-   Graphic design
-   Janitorial work
-   Teaching
-   Construction work

### Portfolio income

Portfolio income comes from investments such as dividends, interest, royalties and capital gains. For example, you might buy stock in a corporation at a low price and sell your shares for profit when they increase in value. This would be considered a capital gain and fall in the category of portfolio income. Many people use portfolio income to save for retirement or generate extra money for large purchases. Here are a few more examples:

-   Becoming a shareholder in a company
-   Opening a savings account to earn interest over time
-   Investing in book or music royalties
-   Buying limited amounts of stock in many different corporations
-   Investing in peer-to-peer loans (P2P)
-   Purchasing dividend exchange-traded funds (ETFs)

### Passive income

Passive income is money earned from a rental property, limited partnership or other business in which you're not actively involved. For example, if you invest in a business without participating in its development, you'd be considered a silent investor receiving passive income. Passive income streams typically require an upfront investment and time to grow and maintain profit. However, investments like these can provide you with a regular stream of income in the future with little to no effort on your part. Here are a few more examples of passive income:

-   Receiving loyalties from online book sales
-   Renting or leasing equipment
-   Renting properties
-   Participating in affiliate marketing
-   Selling independent merchandise from a blog or website
-   Becoming part owner of a business
-   Buying a blog or website

## How do taxes affect the 3 types of income?

Most streams of income are taxed by the government, and tax rates may vary depending on where your money is coming from and how much you're making per year. It's important to understand how taxes might affect alternative streams of income so you can successfully prepare for the future and calculate potential financial risks before they occur. Here are some factors to consider when it comes to paying taxes on the different types of income:

### Active income taxes

The revenue generated by income taxes is typically used to finance government actions and programs depending on federal and state budgets. Income tax rates vary based on how much money you make in one calendar year. Individuals with lower salaries are typically taxed at lower rates than higher-income taxpayers, and tax rates may change over time if there's a pay increase. For example, if you receive a promotion and pay raise, your income tax rates will increase accordingly depending on your yearly salary and tax bracket.

### Portfolio income taxes

Portfolio income, or any money you make from dividends, capital gains or interest, is usually taxed at a lower rate than earned income. Portfolio income is not subject to Social Security or Medicare taxes. Like income tax rates, the amount you owe depends on how much money you're making from each stream of revenue annually.

### Passive income taxes

Tax rates on each type of passive income vary based on how long your investments are held and the amount of profit earned. Capital gains from short-term investments are typically taxed at a higher rate than long-term ones. For example, if you buy and sell a stock that produces $8,000 over the course of a year, you'll likely be taxed more than if you held onto the stock for two or three years.
