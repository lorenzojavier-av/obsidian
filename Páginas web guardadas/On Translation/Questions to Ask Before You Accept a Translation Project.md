Below are a number of questions you should keep in mind each time you receive a new project request (especially from a new client), so that you can be sure to avoid any surprises or problems down the road.

You can use this as a sort of checklist each time you receive a new request; be sure to glance through each topic and consider the answers to all the questions we’ve listed before you even quote the job. You don’t necessarily need to ask the client all of these questions for each project you quote—just remember that addressing these topics as early as possible will help clear up any misunderstandings, make you appear professional, and ensure that your client will be as satisfied as possible in the end.

### The Task at Hand

Before you accept—or even quote—a project, think generally about what you are being asked to do.

**Does the client need translation only or translation and editing?**

_If a second editor is needed, make sure you have someone lined up and that their services will fit into your budget._

**Can you open all the files you received?**

_Make sure you can open and view all files received from the client, especially if sent through a secure link online or if there are audio/video files involved. Some clients may remove files after you confirm receipt, or there could be a zip file that you are unable to open. It is crucial to identify these problems as early as possible before you get started, so you don’t misquote or misjudge the amount of work you have to do._

**Is the document fully legible?**

_If not, how will you handle illegible text?_

**Do you need a better copy if the source file is scanned?**

_The client may have access to the hard copy of the document in order to provide a better scanned electronic copy._

**Do you need to work in a specific software tool?**

_Do you own that software tool, or will the client provide you the means to use it?_

**Is there any handwritten text?**

_If so, how will you handle handwritten text?_

**Is the project confirmed or potential?**

_Does the client expect to receive a confirmation soon, or is this a project that multiple vendors may be bidding on?_

### The Bigger Picture

In addition to the questions above, before quoting or accepting a project it is a good idea to think about the bigger picture. The document(s) you are being asked to translate may be part of a bigger project scope that you are not seeing, and the decisions you make on this project could have ramifications later on.

**What is the purpose of the translation?**

_This will help to inform your translation decisions._

**Who is your target audience?**

_This will help determine the register you use in your translation._

**Have you done projects of this nature for this client before?**

_You may not realize that this project is similar to one you did previously, from which you can extract terminology or background information for the current project._

**Who will own the translation rights after the project is completed?**

_For example, you may want to know if you can use this translation as a sample of your work to include in your professional portfolio. You may also want to know if you can be credited for the translation._

**Is this part of a recurring assignment or ongoing project?**

_You may wish to develop a thorough glossary and TM early on, and take careful notes on your translation decisions, if this project is expected to continue for a long period of time._

### Pricing and Deadline

Now you have gotten to the point where you are ready to negotiate a price and a deadline. Here are a few more considerations to keep in mind. You should also check out the items under “Resources” and “Delivery” for a few more questions that may impact the price you quote.

**How much actual work time will this take you?**

_Estimate how many words you can translate per hour and divide the number of words in the text by this number._

**What lead time do you need to finish the project?**

_Even if you only need 8-10 hours to complete the project, you may want to build in extra time in case you experience any technology issues, to accommodate other projects that may come up, or to fit in other commitments you may have going on. It may be better to tell the client a time range in days (e.g. “3-4 business days upon approval”) rather than a specific date so that you have some leeway in case the project is not accepted right away._

**Will you offer a discount based on repetitions and/or TM matches?**

_For example, if you already translated 50% of this document for the same client and you only need to translate the remaining half, you may want to give them a discount of some kind on the first 50% of the text._

**If the translation is urgent, will you charge extra?**

_Some translators charge an extra percentage of the invoice for projects due within a tight time frame (e.g. 24 hours or x number of words per business day), or projects that require weekend/holiday work._

**What are the terms of payment?**

_Many translation projects are paid 15, 30, 60, or 90 days upon receipt of invoice, but for a larger project you may want to ask for a deposit up front._

**Do you trust this client to pay on time?**

_You can check on the client’s reliability by looking them up on [Payment Practices](http://www.paymentpractices.net/) or [ProZ Blue Board](http://www.proz.com/blueboard), or by checking with trusted colleagues as to their authenticity and payment habits._

**What method of payment will be used?**

_The client may have a preferred method of payment and you will need to make sure you can receive funds that way—for example, PayPal, check, and wire transfer are three common methods of payment in the U.S._

**Who will pay any payment fees?**

_Wire transfers and PayPal often have associated fees, and you will want to agree with the client in advance on who will absorb these fees. Alternatively, you can build these fees into your rate._

### Source Text

Take a closer look at the source text to learn more about what you will be translating.

**What is the subject matter?**

_Many translators specialize in specific subject areas based on their experience and background, but most importantly you must be familiar enough with the source text domain to produce a quality translation._

**Is the entire document in the correct source language?**

_You may receive a long text that appears to be entirely in your source language, but partway through, you find a portion of text in another language. How will you handle this in the target text?_

**What country/variant/locale is the source file from?**

_Make sure you are familiar with the country and language variant your source text originated from._

**Should you correct errors in the source text, if applicable?**

_Sometimes you may find errors (spelling, grammar, etc.) in the source text; it is a good idea to ask the client how to handle these when you find an error._

### Resources

Before you start the project, keep in mind the following questions about research and resources, and be sure to ask the client if you have any doubts or concerns.

**Is there a glossary or TM you should work from?**

_Make sure you are not doing more work than you have to, especially if the client has an established glossary they want you to work from._

**Do you understand the text and terminology, and will you be able to research it sufficiently to produce a quality translation?**

_Have you reviewed the document thoroughly enough to determine that you are able to translate it?_

**Is the document confidential?**

_You may wish to share small portions of the text with colleagues as you research, in order to ask for their input; but first, you need to make sure it is okay to share._

### Deliverable

Before you’ve even accepted the project, think about the end deliverable. You will need to be sure that you have checked with the client to align your expectations on the following topics.

**What variant of your language should the target text be in?**

_Before you get started, be sure to check with the client as to what target language variation should be used, and that you are well-versed in this variant’s conventions so you can produce a top-notch target file._

**What degree of formatting will be expected of you?**

_You may come upon images, charts, and graphs in the source file. Check with the client to find out if they want you to translate these, and determine whether you will charge extra for additional formatting._

**What is the file format of the deliverable(s)?**

_Be sure to know what type of file you are expected to submit. Generally, clients will want a \*.doc file if the source was a \*.doc file; however, sometimes you will be expected to convert the source file into another format or provide a TMX or XLIFF file in addition to a translation exported from a CAT tool._

**Will a translator’s statement be needed?**

_Especially for official documents (birth certificates and so on), clients may ask you to provide a signed “certificate” stating that the translation is accurate to the best of your knowledge. Consider whether this is needed, whether it will have to be notarized, and whether you will charge extra for these services._

What other questions do you ask yourself (and your client!) before starting a translation project? Have you found that keeping a list like this on hand helps you identify any potential issues early on and enable a smoother process going forward?
