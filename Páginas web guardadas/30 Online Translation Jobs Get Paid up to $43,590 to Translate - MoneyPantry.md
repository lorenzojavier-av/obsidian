![Top 30 companies that hire online freelance translators.](https://moneypantry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/freelance-translation-jobs.jpg "Legit translation jobs")If you grew up in a bilingual household, there are many jobs that could use your skills.

With the Internet, the possibilities of [work at home](https://moneypantry.com/legitimate-work-from-home-jobs/) translation jobs have opened up, and it’s likely you can find something which fits in with your schedule and your abilities.

Aside from simple translation jobs, you could be involved in interpreting, online teaching, or bilingual telephone calls.

## Finding translator jobs on freelancing sites

In addition to the job boards mentioned above, which deal mainly in translation, there are other more general job boards and freelancing sites where you could look for translating opportunities.

**These include:**

1.  Fiverr.com
2.  Freelancer.com,
3.  Guru.com,
4.  iFreelance.com,
5.  PeoplePerHour.com, and
6.  UpWork.com, formerly odesk.com, which now includes elance.com, another popular online destination.

### How much do translators earn?

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, [the median pay for translators in 2014](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/media-and-communication/interpreters-and-translators.htm) was $43,590 per year, which translate (no pun intended) to $20.96 per hour.

Of course, there is no standard rate for translations.

Tasks can range from translating hundreds of pages of technical or legal jargon to simply facilitating with email correspondence.

The amount you make depends to some extent on how difficult the translation is, but is always subject to your negotiations.

Having said that, the rates can be $.10 or $.20 per word, or you may be paid by the hour.

Hourly rates can range from $10 to $100, depending on your speed and abilities.

It obviously helps if you have a professional certification in translation.

### How to become a certified translator

You will find various training and certification programs online, but the main one to aim for is organized by [the American Translators Association](http://www.atanet.org/certification/landing_want_to_be_certified.php) (ATA).

They conduct a certification exam which then allows you to use the designation CT (certified translator) after your name.

This provides the potential client with a measure of your worth, and will usually mean that you are paid more.

### Is it for you?

Professional translation is not a job that you can decide to do, and then train for a couple of months.

It requires that you have the right background, and a multilingual ability.

It generally requires that you speak the destination language like a native.

If you are fortunate enough to have been raised with a second language, or you have later become bilingual, then there are many opportunities for you to start a full or part-time translation career.
