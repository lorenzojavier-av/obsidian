-   If you come across a file with no audio, report it. Raw transcripts should only contain the audio; time-codes, headers/footers, speaker tracking, etcetera are not needed.
-   Nothing should be omitted from the audio, unless specified.
-   If there are any inaudible sections, they should be marked with \_\_\_\_.
-   Simply label laughter as \[laughter\] or \[chuckle\].
-   Unfinished sentences or pauses mid-sentence should be noted with ellipsis(…).
-   Words such as wanna, gonna, kinda or contractions should not be expanded.
-   With the exception of measurements, numbers one to nine should be transcribed in letters.
-   There should be no more than 2 mistakes for every 10 comprehensible words spoken.
-   Start a new paragraph with each new speaker and they should be separated with an empty line.
-   Fillers (you know, like, etc.) and Utterances (Uh, Um, etc.) should be omitted unless it’s  strict verbatim.

Suggestion styles:

-   Spelled-out names should be capitalized and spaced with hyphens.
-   Spell out etcetera (not etc.)
-   It’s i.e. and not ie.

You are graded on a 5-point scale: A+/Excellent = 5, D/Poor = 1.  The minimum average for a transcription grade is 3.15. If your account falls below this, your account will be disabled.

Your first 10 files are crucial.  If these do not score well, you can’t do anything about it.

There’s a monthly bonus of $5 for every 3 hrs credited in a calendar month.  More money is paid for high difficulty files as they require more time and effort.

****Additional Information****  
Differences (Diffs) show the changes made during a review.  Major changes are considered mistakes and those are the ones to pay attention to in the review.

You are encouraged to dispute reviews if you find mistakes or the grade is unfair.  Time frame for disputes is about 1 week of investigation.

Background conversation is always transcribed if it’s clear and audible.

Every transcription times out at 2 hours, with a 1 hour extension provided after the 2 hours are up.

There is an online editor that can be used for transcription. It includes an audio player and text editor.  If you use Google Chrome, you can dictate instead of type.  This saves around 60% of typing effort.

If there are any issues, report them as soon as you can.
