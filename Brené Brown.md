# Brené Brown
## Brené Brown and Tim Ferris
Courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy. Esther Perel. Complacency, self-acceptance, best-self, perfectionism. Developmental view (see what strategies you have developed across the years, find out which of them do not serve me anymore and see how to evolve them), fruitional view (cultivating the acceptance of what is). Lasting meaningful change is achived through self acceptance. Shame-based fear of being ordinary. Book: *Radical Acceptance*. Question: What are you unwilling to feel? Book: *The Body Keeps The Score*. A great Jungian Saying: *"Keep your shadows in front of you, they can only take you down from behind."* What it means to choose affect words carefully? 80/20 strategy.
