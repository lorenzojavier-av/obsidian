# Life Wakes You Up…

The German psychotherapist teacher, and writer, BERT HELLINGER, was 93 years old, and is known worldwide for the creation of the therapeutic method ′′Family Constellation”.  He passed away on 19/9/19.  
  
He left this wonderful text:  
  
Life disappoints you to stop living with illusions and see reality.  

Life destroys everything superfluous until only the important remains.  

Life doesn’t leave you alone, so you can stop blaming yourself and accept everything as ′′ is “.  

Life is going to withdraw what you have, until you stop complaining and start to thank.  

Life sends conflicting people to heal you, so you stop looking out and start reflecting who you are inside.  

Life lets you fall again and again, until you decide to learn the lesson.

Life takes you out of the way and presents you crossroads, until you stop wanting to control everything and flow like a river.  

Life puts your enemies on the road, until you stop reacting.  

Life scares you and will scare you as many times as necessary, until you lose your fear and regain your faith.  

Life distances you from the people you love, until you understand that we are not that body, but the soul it contains.  

Life laughs at you many, many times, until you stop taking everything so seriously and you can laugh at yourself.  

Life breaks you in as many parts as it takes, so that light penetrates you.  

Life confronts you against rebels, until you stop trying to control.  

Life repeats the same message, if necessary with screams and covers, until you finally hear it.
  
Life sends lightning and storms, to wake you up.  

Life humiliates you and sometimes defeats you again and again until you decide to let your ego die.  

Life denies you goods and greatness until you stop wanting goods and greatness and begin to serve.  

Life cuts your wings and prunes your roots, until you need wings or roots, just disappear in the forms and your being flies.  

Life denies you miracles, until you understand everything is a miracle.  

Life shortens your time, so you can hurry to learn to live.  

Life ridicules you until you do nothing, no one, so that then it turns you into everything.  

Life doesn’t give you what you want, but what you need to evolve.  

Life hurts you and haunts you until you drop your whims and tantrums and appreciate your breath.

Life hides treasures from you until you learn to come to life and seek them.  

Life denies you God, until you see Him in everyone and everything.  

Life wakes you up, prunes you, breaks you down, disappoints you… but believe me, that’s for your best self to manifest… until only love remains in you “.
