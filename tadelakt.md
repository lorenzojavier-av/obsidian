Tadelakt is a technique for applying [#limeplaster](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/limeplaster?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZXQiXgRfKrYRM1LNCdCffzdSPrgq5FDMp6F1kPSYO6htVq8GTFGmcOzyqNhmpw3ybSIJEUToYPp6VJUO1x0f9RSz7gYH8llpUjzJYfiAudkWP1BbKIdw0mccPI7yc2IR8b4ruAHJk799GD4Nsw07oSgFPcBjcH4ecW14lEJDkaNIbxT8ajxY0PdJKz6CSY0tKc&__tn__=*NK-R) that results in a water-repellant surface. It was developed in Morocco thousands of years ago (and different regions in the world have similar techniques).

Tadelakt uses a very lime-rich plaster. That means there is extra sticky binder (the lime) and not as much aggregate (sand). If you applied this as a normal plaster, it would crack like crazy.

That's where technique comes in.

To prevent the cracking, you compress the plaster by burnishing it. Simply...you are going over and over the surface with increasingly firm pressure...and that pressure compresses the plaster into the wall and closes any would-be-cracks before they develop.

The secret magic is then applying a black olive oil soap. The key is soap with stearic acid, which (if you get your timing right) reacts with some of the uncreated lime (calcium hydroxide) ... and creates calcium stearate, which is basically a wax.

But because you are burnishing, you've pushed that chemical reaction inside the surface of the lime plaster, thus creating an integral waxy finish that is in (not on) the lime plaster. This wax is what makes the plaster water-resistant.

Timing is everything here. So practice practice practice before you commit to a large project.
